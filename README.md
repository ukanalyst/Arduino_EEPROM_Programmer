# Arduino_EEPROM_Programmer

This is code for my build of Ben Eater's Arduino EEPROM Programmer. The code is designed to work with a CSI CAT28C16AP-20 EEPROM chip.

- You can find Ben's excellent tutorial to build your own programmer [here](https://youtu.be/K88pgWhEb1M)

- You can find the datasheet for the CSI CAT28C16AP-20 chip [here](http://pdf1.alldatasheet.com/datasheet-pdf/view/57386/CATALYST/CAT28C16AP-20.html)

- I bought my chips from [here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/CAT28C16API-20-CAT28C16API-90-28C16/2038081849.html)
